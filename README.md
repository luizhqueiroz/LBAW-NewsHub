NewsHub brings fans of movies and series together like never before! Designed for dynamic interaction, our platform lets users share, discuss, and explore everything in the entertainment world. Users can post, edit, and delete news, follow movie genres through tags, and engage with others by commenting, liking, and following. With real-time notifications for likes, comments, and follows, and a trending page that highlights the hottest and most talked about movies powered by the TMDB API, NewsHub keeps you up-to-date with what’s buzzing in cinemas and beyond. Top influencers stand out visually, and admins maintain a safe and engaging community with robust moderation tools.

Built on cutting-edge technology, NewsHub combines PHP and the Laravel Framework for backend development, JavaScript for interactivity, and Bootstrap for responsive design.
